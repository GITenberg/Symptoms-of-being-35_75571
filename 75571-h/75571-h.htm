<p>The other night one of my friends
whose name is Legion got me on the
telephone some way another and
wanted I should come over and call,
but that is all I done the last 3 or 4
times I had went over there and it
costs a lot of money even in a 4 bit
limit. So I said no that I was busy on
a book which I had promised my publisher
I would write it.</p>

<p>“What is it about” says Legion.</p>

<p>So I told him “How it feels to be
35.”</p>

<p>“That guy must think you got a
good memory” says Legion and hung
up on me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>Well friends 35 is how young I am
no matter how old I look, but I am so
use to haveing smart Alex make wise
cracks when I tell them my age that
it don’t have no more effect on me
now than the 6 day bicycle race.
Only I can’t figure why they think I
would lie about it like I was trying to
pose as a boy chess marvel or something.
When a man has got a legal
wife and 4 and no one hundredths
children what does he care if he is 35
or double that amt. Besides which
they claim that 35 is about the average
of all the grown ups in the world.
If I was above the average would I
keep it a secret? Don’t be silly.</p>

<p>And don’t judge a person by their
hair gents. Many a man that can remember
the first Ford has got more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>foliage on their egg than myself and
also I know several ball players in the
big league to-day that is anywheres
from 5 to 30 yrs. younger than the
present writer that when the fish applauds
them for makeing a 2 handed
catch with 1 hand, you wonder why
they don’t take off their cap. Personly
I am not sensitive about my
plummage. When my features got to
the decision that one of them would
half to retract all I done was thank
God they picked the forehead and not
the chin. The only hardship connected
with pyorrhea of the scalp is
trying to act supprised when the barber
says you are looseing your hair.</p>

<p>But I guess it ain’t only the loss of
a few ebony ringlets that makes me
look senile. It seems like I was over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>estimated long before I begin to molt.
For inst. I can recall when I was 16
and had a thatch on my dome like a
virtuoso and I used to pal around
with a boy who we will call Geo.
Dougan because that was his name
and Geo. was going on 21. Well this
was in Niles, Mich., in the days when
they sold 6 <span class="num">7</span>/<span class="den">8</span> beer in vases and for
$.20 you could get enough to patrol
4th St. serenading true music lovers
of the opposing sex. In them hellcyon
days 1 of the few things that was vs.
the law was selling it to minors and
2 or 3 of the retail mchts. around
town was pretty strick and time and
again I and Geo. would be out shopping
and go in a store and order 2
vats and Dave or Punk or who ever it
happened to be would set one up for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>me to knock over and then give Geo.
a wise cracking smile and ask him
would he like a bottle of white pop.
Incidentally I had a taste of that
lucius ambrosia at a ball game once
and if the penalty for selling honest
old beer to minors was a $100 fine
why 2 to 14 yrs. in a meat grinder
would be mild for a guy that sells
white pop on the theory that its a
drink.</p>

<p>Well Geo. would say “Aw come on
Dave I am older than him.” But you
couldn’t fool Dave and the result was
that we would half to take our custom
down to Pigeon’s where everybody
that had a dime was the same age and
the only minors was the boys that
tried to start a charge acct.</p>

<p>I must hand it to Geo. for one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>thing. No matter how sore it made
him to get turned down he never told
them the truth about me. And they
wouldn’t of believed him if he had of.
No more than you birds believe me
now.</p>

<p>But now in regards to this book:
When the publisher asked me to write
it up I said I didn’t see how more
than only a few people would be interested
because they was only a few
that is this old. So he told me that as
a matter of fact pretty near everybody
in the world that can read is
either 35 or a few mos. one way or the
other and if I didn’t think that was
so to go and look it up in a book. So
I looked up in the encyclopedia and
they was nothing in there like he said
but I found out a whole lot of other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>things that was news to me and maybe
the reader don’t know them
neither so I will write them down.</p>

<p>In the 1st. place it says that most
people dies when they are 1 yr. old
and the 1st. 10 yrs. is the most fatalist.
But if they’s a 100 thousand people
that can manage to get to be 10
yrs. old why then 749 of them is
pretty libel to die the next yr. After
that the older you get the longer you
live up to when you are 59 and then
you can just about count on liveing
14 and seven-tenths yrs. more. In
other wds. if you ain’t one of the 749
that crokes between 10 and 11 why
you are safe till about June of the yr.
when you are 73. So a person is a
sucker to try and take care of themself
at my age and from now on I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>am going to be a loose fish and run
wild.</p>

<p>Out in Benton Harbor, Mich. however,
near where I use to live, they
have got a sex that calls themselfs the
Holy Terrors or something that
claims you live as long as you are
good and as soon as you do wrong you
die. But I notice that they all wear a
beard so as the encyclopedia can’t tell
if they are 73 or 21.</p>

<p>Another thing it says in the book is
that figures compiled in Norway and
Sweden shows the death rate amongst
bachelors is a lot more than amongst
married men even includeing murder.
So anybody that is between 11 and 73
yrs. old and got a wife is practically
death proof especially if you are a
Swede.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>But all that is either here or there.
The idear is to tell how it feels to be
my age and I may as well get to it.
Well in the 1st. place I am speaking
for myself only. I don’t know how
the other 35 yr. olders feels about it
and don’t care. Probably the most
of them don’t feel near as old as the
writer. Laughter is supposed to
keep a man young but if its forced
laughter it works the opp. When a
guy is named Ring W. and is expected
to split their sides when ever
somebody asks if your middle name is
Worm which is an average of 365
times per annum over a period of 35
annums, why it can’t help from telling
on you. Or it don’t lighten the
wgt. of the yrs. none to half to snicker
every time they say Ring give me a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>ring or Ring why ain’t you a ring
master in Ringling Bros. And yet a
number of birds has asked me if that
was my real name or did I assume it.
They would probably ask the kaiser
if he moved to Holland to be near the
tulips.</p>

<p>I suppose that on the morning of
their 21st. birthday the right kind of a
American citizen wakes up full of excitement
and says to themself “Now
I am of age and can vote and everything.”
And when they come to what
I often call the 35th. mile stone they
are even more smoked up with the
thought that now they are eligible to
be President and go around all day
stoop shouldered with the new responsibility.</p>

<p>Well I don’t recall how I woke up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>the day I was 21 if at all but my last
birthday is still green and sour in my
memory. I spent the most of it in
Mineola signing mortgages and if I
thought of the White House it was
just to wonder if it would do any good
to write and tell President Wilson
about the Long Island R. R.</p>

<p>At the present writeing I have got
so use to being 35 that I don’t know if
it feels any different from 34 or 33.
But I can at lease state that being 35
don’t feel nothing like being under
30. For inst. when the telephone
rings now days I am scared to death
that its somebody asking us to go
somewheres for dinner or somewheres.
Six yrs. ago I was afraid it
wasn’t. At 29 home was like they say
on the vaudeville stage, a place to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>when all the other joints was closed
up. At 35 its a place you never leave
without a loud squawk.</p>

<p>A man don’t appreciate their home
till you are up around par for 9 holes.
Under 30 you think of it as a dump
where you can’t pick out what you
want to eat like roast Vt. turkey or a
filet mignon or some of that prune
fed muskrat a la Biltmore. If Kathleen
decides in the <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> that you are
going to crave spare ribs at night why
you can either crave spare ribs at
night or put on a hunger strike that
won’t get you no more sympathy than
the hiccups.</p>

<p>In them ribald days home is just a
kind of a pest where you half to choke
down breakfast or they will think
something ails you and talk about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>sending for a Dr. And 1 or 2 evenings
per wk. when you can’t think
of no reason to go out, its where you
half to set around and wait for 9
o’clock so as you begin to talk about
going to bed and sometimes things
gets so desperate that you half to read
a book or something.</p>

<p>But at 35 you spell it with a big H.
Its where you can take off your shoes.
Its where you can have more soup.
Its where you don’t half to say nothing
when they’s nothing to say. Its
where they don’t wait till the meal is
all over and then give you a eye dropper
full of coffee raw. Its where you
don’t half to listen. Its where they
don’t smear everything with cheese
dressing. Its where you can pan
everybody without it going no further.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Its where they know you like
doughnuts and what you think about
a banana.</p>

<p>When you was 29 you didn’t care
for the band to play Home sweet
Home. It was old stuff and a rotten
tune any way. Now you hope they
won’t play it neither. Its a pretty
tune but it makes you bust out crying.</p>

<p>Bud Holland that lives over to Port
Washington wrote a piece for a
magazine a wile ago where he said in
it that it kind of shocked him to find
out that young people didn’t act like
he was one of them no more. Well he
ain’t but it took the old gaffer a long
time to find it out. Here he is pretty
near 39 and I guess the old Methuselum
wants folks to hide I Mary Mac
Lane when he comes in the rm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p>Well it was 5 or 6 yrs. ago when I
realized that I was past my nonages
as they say. It come to me all of a
sudden that the only compliments I
had for a long wile was what a pretty
tie you got or something. Nothing
about my natural charms no more. It
was an egg’s age since anybody had
called me to 1 side and whispered “I
got a T. L. for you. Gertie thinks
your ears is immense.”</p>

<p>I seen then that I wasn’t no longer
a larva and I guess maybe it hurt at
first. But its like falling hair or the
telephone service or anything else.
When you have lived with it a wile
you don’t mind. Which is just as
well because they ain’t a wk. passes
when you wouldn’t get touched on the
raw if they was any raw left.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>Like for inst. a few wks. back I was
up in Boston where I got a young and
beautiful sister in law. When it come
time to part from she and her husband
she kissed me 6 times which was
suppose to be once for me and once
apiece for the Mrs. and 4 kiddies.
Well I thought it was pretty nice and
got kind of excited about it till I
looked at her husband to see how he
took it. He took it without batting an
eye. To him it was like as if she was
kissing an old cab horse on a bet for
the benefit of the Red Cross. And
when I had left and they was alone
together, instead of lepping at her
throat with a terrible curse he probably
says “Janey, you’re a good game
gal,” and she give him a kiss that
meant something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>Now an incidence like this would of
spoilt my whole trip if I didn’t look
at it in a sensible way which is to say
to yourself, “Well if I wasn’t in the
Sears and yellow I wouldn’t of got
them 6 kisses. And 6 kisses is <span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span> a
dozen kisses in any language.”</p>

<p>Or for inst. out on the golf course.
Suppose I and Grant Rice is playing
with some young whipper snapper
like say Jack Wheeler and they’s
only 1 caddy for the 3 of us. “Take
them two” says Jack pointing to my
and Grant’s bags but the caddy has
all ready took them any way as soon
as he found out which ones belonged
to which. Or when one of my young
brother in laws is around the house
and I come in the rm. and they are
setting in the easy chair, why they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>jump up like food shot from guns and
say “Here take this chair.”</p>

<p>All and all when you get hardened
to it they’s many advantages in
reaching your dottage. When they’s
7 passengers for a 7 passenger car its
never you that has to take one of them
little torture seats. When your
brother in law is here on a visit and
the Mrs. thinks it would be nice to
have a fire in the fire place, you ain’t
the one that has got to ruin his
clothes. Yes friends the benefits is
many fold but if them <span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span> dozen kisses
and a few stray others pretty near as
good was all, why you could still
think to yourself Youth may get good
service, but 35 ain’t makeing no complaints
to the management neither.</p>

<p>As for the gen. symptoms of 35 and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>vicinity as I have found them and not
speaking for nobody only myself you
understand, the following points may
interest science:</p>

<p>1. The patient sometimes finds
himself and one lady the only people
left at the table and all the others is
danceing. They seems to be nothing
for it but to get up and dance. You
start and the music stops and the
young buddies on the flr. claps their
hands for a encore. The patient
claps his hands too but not very loud
and he hopes to high heaven the
leader will take it in a jokeing way.</p>

<p>2. For some reason another its
necessary to find some old papers and
in going through the trunk the patient
runs acrost a bunch of souvenirs
and keep sakes like a note a gal wrote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>him in high school, a picture of himself
in a dirty football suit, a program
of the 1907 May festival in South
Bend and etc. “Why keep this
junk” he says and dumps them all in
the waste basket.</p>

<p>3. The case develops nausea in the
presents of all story tellers except
maybe Irvin Cobb and Riley Wilson
and Bert Williams. Any others has
to work pretty fast to get him cornered.
Violent chills attends the
sound of those saddest wds. of tongue
or pen “I don’t know if you heard
this one or not but it struck me funny.
It seems they was a woman went in a
drygoods store in Detroit to buy some
towels. Stop me if you heard it
before.” You couldn’t stop them
with big Bertha. The best funny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>storys is Balzac’s because they are
in a book and you don’t half to buy it.
But when you get up vs. one of these
here voluntary stag entertainers you
either got to listen and laugh or they
put you down as a dumb bell.</p>

<p>4. The invalid goes to a ball game
and along comes the last <span class="num">1</span>/<span class="den">2</span> of the
14th. innings and the score is 1 and 1
and the 1st. guy up makes a base hit.
The patient happens to look at his
watch and it says 11 minutes to 6 and
if he leaves the park right away he
can make the 6:27 home where as if
he waits a few min. he will half to
take the 6:54. Without no hesitation
he leaves the park right away and
makes the 6:27.</p>

<p>5. The subject is woke up at 3
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> by the fire whistle. He sniffles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>but can’t smell no smoke. He thinks
well it ain’t our house and goes back
to sleep.</p>

<p>6. He sets down after breakfast to
read the paper. The mail man comes
and brings him 3 letters. One of
them looks like it was a gal’s writeing.
He reads the paper.</p>

<p>7. He buys a magazine in April
and reads the first instalment of a
misery serial. The instalment winds
up with the servants finding their
master’s body in bed and his head in
the ash tray. Everything pts. to the
young wife. Our patient forgets to
buy the May number.</p>

<p>8. Somebody calls up and says
they are giveing a party Thursday
night for Mabel Normand and can
you come. Our hero says he is sorry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>but he will be in Washington on business.
He hasn’t no more business in
Washington than Gov. Cox.</p>

<p>9. They’s a show in town that you
got to see like Frank Craven or
“Mecca.” “It’s a dandy night”
says the Mrs. “Shall we drive in or
take the train?” “We will take the
train” says our hero.</p>

<p>These is a few of the symptoms as I
have observed them and as I say I am
speaking for just myself and maybe
I am a peculiar case. They may not
be another 35 yr. older in the world
that is affected the same way and in
fact I know several suffers about that
age which I am as different than as
day and night. Take Jess Willard
for inst. He was somewheres around
35 in July 1919 and Dempsey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>knocked him down 7 times in one rd.
He wouldn’t do that to me, not 7
times he wouldn’t. Or look at Ty
Cobb. Do you think they would get
me to play center field and manage a
ball club for $30,000? Or would Jim
Thorpe’s brother in law look on him
as too frail to hobble down in the
basement and get a few sticks of
wood?</p>

<p>On the other hand they might be 2
or 3 brother eagles in the mediocer
30s that is even more mildewed than
me, but I am afraid they’s a whole lot
more of them feels like a colt. They
take care of themselfs. When they
get up in the <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> they take a cold
plunge and then hang by their eye
teeth on a hook in the closet while
they count 50 in Squinch. And noons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>when they come back from their
lunch of hot milk and ferns, they roll
over on the office rug 10 times without
bending their shin.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">When they get up in the A. M. they take

50 in Squinch.... I can’t compete with these
babies. I slice a few golf balls in season but
bet. Nov. and May the only exercise I get or
want to get is twice a wk. when I take the buttons
out of shirt A and stick them in shirt B.

I take the buttons out of shirt A and
stick them in shirt B.</p>

<p>They’s still another crowd yet that
renews their youth by going back
every yr. to commencement or a class
reunion or something. Well I don’t
know if I want to renew my youth or
not. Leave bad enough alone is my
slogum. And in the 2d. place I don’t
half to go nowheres to a class reunion.
I could hold it in the bath tub. I was
the only one that graduated when I
did as it was in March of my freshman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>yr. and they didn’t seem to be
haveing no commencement exercises
for nobody else. I guess I must have
been one of these here infantile proteges
like that 11 mos. old junior they
got up to Columbia.</p>

<p>No book of this kind would be
complete without shooting a few wds.
of unwanted advice at my youngers
and betters. For inst. John D. tells
the boys how to build up a fortune
and John Jones tells them how to rise
from a white wings to a steeple jack.
So it looks like it was up to me to tell
them how to get to be what I am, 35
yrs. old.</p>

<p>Well my lads they’s 4 rules that I
made and have stuck to them and I
think you will find they’ll bring you
the same results. The 1st. rule is
don’t die the 1st. yr. The 2d. rule is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>don’t be one of the 749 that dies when
they are 11. The 3d rule is don’t pick
a quarrel with a man like Dempsey.
And the 4th. and last rule is marry a
girl like Sue.</p>

<p>In explanations of that last rule I
will say that the one I married ain’t
Sue but the name don’t make no differents
if she is the right kind of a
gal. And the reason I say that is
because its customary in these intimate
capital I talks to throw in a
paragraph of blurb about the little
woman. What ever success a man
has had he has got to pretend he
owes it to Her. So if they’s any glory
to be gleaned out of my success in
reaching 35 and looking even older
why she can have it.</p>
